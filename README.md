- 👋 Hi, I’m @SubinayToppo, a third year college student.
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics, mainly digital electronics and computer architecture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning electronics, mostly interested in digital VLSI and CPU architectures.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project involving digital electronics.
- 📫 How to reach me: mail me at subinaytoppo@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My hobbies include watching movies (a lot), reading mangas and watching animes.

- This Git contains most of the (serious?) work I do on Verilog. This includes modules and testbenches which I try to write. Well writing testbenches are especially hard.
- Feel free to reach me if you need any help in building testbenches or to understand anything in Verilog. In the future I look forward to learn more things in Verilog, as well as start learning VHDL.

- Siging off guys! Have a good day. Sayonara!
